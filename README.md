- x = str(3)    *#x will be '3'*
- y = int(3)    *#y will be 3*

## Notes

**Single or Double Quotes**
Double quotes is the same thing as single quotes in python, both mean string.

**Case-Sensitive**
a as a variable is completely different then A as a variable.

**Naming Rules**
- A variable name must start with a letter or underscore
- A variable name can not be a number
- A variable can only contain (A-z, 0-9, and _)
- Are case sensitive
